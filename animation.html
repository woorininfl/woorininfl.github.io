						<p> This project was challenging for me as well, from choosing the right subject to dealing with Adobe Animate.
						When I worked in a broadcasting company as a content planner, my co-workers always complained to me that animation takes too much time and costs. They wanted me to reduce the amount of animation as much as possible. Now I could understand why they told me so.
						
						Before starting this project, I thought creating an animation for 15 minutes would not take that long. And as you all can imagine, I turned out to be wrong...
						
						I thought an intuitive and abstract notion would be better delivered with animation. So I chose 'Electrostatic Induction' as the subject for this project. This notion is taught to the students in the second or third grade of Middle School in South Korea. I imagined a classroom situation where the teacher uses this animation to show an example of electrostatic induction.
						
						Using the software, Adobe Animate, was interesting. However, understanding several new concepts (such as keyframe or marking, adding color effect with alpha) and adjusting myself to the skills were not easy for me. So I reviewed the tutorials over and over again.
						
						In the animation production, I divided the story into two scenes where their backgrounds remained the same.
						
						In the first scene, the rod object following a controlled path gets closer to the fur (Both of the vector images in the form of PNG were drawn and imported to Adobe Animate). After that, I added a rubbing motion. At the end of the first scene, I tried to incorporate a transition effect with which the first scene fades out gradually. In the second scene, the two objects - a can and a rod - move together to the edge of the table, which shows the result of the electrostatic induction effect.
						
						At the final stage, I inserted a title page (for about a second) and the narration with Movie Maker. </p>
