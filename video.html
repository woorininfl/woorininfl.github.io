					<p> When I was employed by an educational broadcasting company, I had the opportunity to see a range of instructional video clips and offer commentary on them. But I didn't realize at the time how much time and work goes into producing an informative film. Thus, this project was a terrific learning experience to understand how challenging making a video is.

						My video aims to help students learn about the global warming. 
						
						In the video made with Win Movie Maker, the following effects were used:
						
						18 images are included. 
						Several transition effects are applied - such as swiping from the left to the right / inserting from the right / slowly going down or up. zooming, The effects are applied with consistency. For example, when it comes to the intermit questions,  it changes by moving the new images up
						Video effects are integrated - such as camera moving from center to up, panning, or zooming
						Screen captions are also inserted as in 00:12.70, from 00:57.37-01:1.77.
						A formal title is in the first page and the credit with references for music and pictures is in the last page.
						Two background music and narration is used. </p>
