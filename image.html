				<h2>Adobe Photoshop</h2>
				<p> I designed a cover for the book,"The Philosophy of Loneliness". 
					This book was written by Norwegian philosopher Lars Svendsen and published in 2019. 
					I sought to convey the idea of a person in contemporary society who feels alone in a crowd. 
					The background was blurred intentionally to present people passing by meaninglessly. 
					In the middle, an individual was expressed as a black blank image to convey the idea of a person while he or she is empty in the presence of numerous others.
					Through this, I attempted to convey the author's use of the ephemeral concept of "loneliness" among others.
					The book's title was written with a font that conveys a clear and unyielding image.</p>

				<h2>InkScape</h2>
				<p> The logo of "Nature Acupuncture and Herbal Clinic." was changed to better represent the store.
					First, the design was built around natural curves rather than stiff tree and circle imagery.
					Second, focusing on the fact that the majority of herbal medicine ingredients originate from "herbs" rather than "trees,” a medicinal herbal image was centered. 
					Third, in keeping with the clinic's name, "Nature," the earth was represented in the logo, and the spirit of herbs sprouting onto the strength of the soil was used as an image.
					Fourth, a gradient was applied to the background to represent the "energy" found in nature.
					Finally, the font of the logo became neat and soft, and the word “clinic” was added to the logo to indicate what type of business and product is provided in the clinic.</p>
